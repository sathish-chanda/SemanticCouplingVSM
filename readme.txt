given a set of java classes and a target java class.
In this project we are going to compute the cosine similarity of the target and with all the remaining java classes in the given path.
It will display the top most k cosine simliar classes with the target class.


execution steps:
1. open command prompt in pom.xml folder
2. mvn clean
3. mvn install
4. java -jar target/assignment-2.0.jar javaclasses_path targetJavaclass_in_the_given_path kValue
